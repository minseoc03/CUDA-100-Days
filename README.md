# CUDA 100 Days Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **CUDA 100 Days Challenge**!

This project is inspired by [AdepojuJeremy's CUDA 120 Days Challenge](https://github.com/AdepojuJeremy/CUDA-120-DAYS--CHALLENGE/tree/main). I'm committing to 100 days of learning and practicing **CUDA programming**, building up from the fundamentals of GPU programming to more complex CUDA operations and projects.

Since I don't currently have an NVIDIA GPU, I'm using [leetgpu.com](https://leetgpu.com/) to run and test all CUDA code remotely. It's been a great solution for practicing CUDA without needing local GPU resources.

## 📚 Structure

For each day, I record:
- The **main topic** of the day
- A link to my **personal notes** (hosted on Notion)
- A link to the **code folder** for that day

## 🗓️ 100-Day Progress Table

| Day | Main Topic | Note(KOR) | Code |
|:-----:|:------------:|:----------------:|:------:|
| 1 | Hello GPU | [Note](https://minseoc03.notion.site/CUDA-Introduction-to-CUDA-1d16a507bae98082b6a7c58ec510586e) | [Code](daily-updates/day-1-hello-gpu) |
| 2 | CPU vs. GPU | [Note](https://minseoc03.notion.site/CUDA-GPU-vs-CPU-Architecture-Foundations-1d26a507bae98056a981fd36c2587af5) | [Code](daily-updates/day-2-cpu-vs-gpu) |

---

## ✅ Goals

- Master the basics and advanced concepts of CUDA programming
- Build hands-on experience with GPU parallelism
- Create a well-documented journey others can follow or learn from

---

## 🚀 Running Code

Each day's code is located in its corresponding folder (`day01/`, `day02/`, ...).  
Run them on [leetgpu.com](https://leetgpu.com/) or on a local machine with an NVIDIA GPU.
